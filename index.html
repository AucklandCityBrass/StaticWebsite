	       <p>Welcome to Auckland City Brass! We are a community brass group that rehearses in Three Kings, Auckland at <a href="http://maps.google.com/?q=1011+Mt+Eden+Rd,+Three+Kings,+Auckland+1042&hl=en&gl=nz">The Old Pumphouse</a>, on Monday evenings. We frequently perform for community events, as well as in "play outs"/concerts that we hold at our band rooms several times a year. <br>
