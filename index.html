			<h4>THANK YOU TO OUR SUPPORTERS</h4>
			<hr />
			<h5>ACB Wins B Grade Own Choice, Second in B Grade Overall</h5>
			<p>With the 2014 New Zealand National Brass Band Championship now concluded, we would like to extend our heartfelt thanks to everyone who supported ACB in working towards the standard we achieved at this year's competition. Having an audience at our playouts, concerts and online means a lot to us, and played a crucial role in preparing us to walk on stage at Nationals this year.</p>
			<p>Auckland City Brass moved into B Grade in 2012, after winning C Grade in 2011. Since then, but especially in the past twelve months, we have seen a significant shift in the culture and attitude in the band, and our standard has dramatically improved. For the past two years, ACB placed last in B Grade. We are therefore extremely proud to this year be returning home, having placed first in the B Grade Own Choice section, and second in the test.</p>
			<p>From here, it's onwards and upwards for ACB. The year is by no means over - we have many more exciting events coming up, including a concert and the ABA Regional contest. We will continue to work on improving our standard and delivering brass music to our community, and look forward to seeing you there!</p>
