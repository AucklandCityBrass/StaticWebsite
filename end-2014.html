<h6>November, 2014</h6>
<p>Dear Members of Auckland City Brass,</p>
<p>The coming two months are the busiest of 2014 for ACB. I wanted to share my thoughts on the current state of the band and what is required from us, the members, to finish this year on a high note (currently we're somewhere around middle Bb...). This year, for the first time, we are hosting a <i>paid entrance</i> Christmas concert. In many ways, <b>this is as important as, if not more important than the Nationals</b>. At our current standard of performance, audience members will not be getting what they are paying for.</p>
<p>The situation regarding rehearsal attendance is now fairly dire. Unless you have an exam on Tuesday morning or some other <i>exceptional</i> circumstance, as ACB Playing Members, you are <b>expected to be at every single rehearsal from now until the 5th of December</b>. If you know you are not able (or might not be able) to perform at the Christmas concert, please let Richard, Joe, John or Tane know <b><i>NOW.</i></b> Apologies after next Monday (10 November) are not acceptable, and if you do not have apologies in before that date, you will be expected to attend on the day.</p>

<p>If you <i>are</i> available on Friday 5th November, please <i>stay</i> available. This is a major event for the band, and we all need to be focussed and committed to delivering an awesome performance on the day. The band is paying nearly a thousand dollars for the venue hire and advertising of this concert, so giving a good impression and getting a good audience is important. We need at least 70 audience members at $10/person just to break even, and ideally we would like to make a profit. Invite your friends and family; share the event to your Facebook friends, and post fliers (we will provide these to you) at work.</p>

<p>Our first paid concert is a milestone that we have been working towards as a band for the past several years. As part of our continued improvement as a band, we need to get more performance experience and be more visible in the wider Auckland community. Most of us, as band members, have been slacking off since the Nationals and this is not the mark of a good bandsman/bandswoman. As of next Monday, the baton comes down at 7:30pm sharp - be there, and be there on time. As John said earlier this week, it's two hours. Even with two hours' extra for transport, this amounts to 2.38% of your week. We are not asking for much (although the odd bit of practise in your own time is probably a good idea!)</p>

<p>To sum up:</p>

<ol>
<li>The band is currently not good enough to deliver the quality expected by a paying audience.</li>
<li>We have a <b>major</b> (paid) concert on the 5th of December.</li>
<li><b>ALL</b> Playing Members are expected to attend <b>ALL</b> rehearsals from now until the 5th December (at the very least).</li>
<li>IF you cannot <b>guarantee</b> your attendance at any reharsal OR at the concert: please talk to myself or another committee member <b><i>NOW</i></b></li>
<li>Deadline for all but the most exceptional of apologies is <i>10 November at 9:30pm.</i></li>
</ol>

<p>That concludes my (slightly grumpy) rant! On a positive note, ACB has come an amazingly long way since last year and I am confident that we can deliver some stunning performances during this year's carolling season. All of this push to get the band more involved in paid concerts and public gigs will make us a better band in the long run, and is the first step towards placing in B Grade next year!</p>

<p>Thanks and see you all next week at 7:30pm!</p>
